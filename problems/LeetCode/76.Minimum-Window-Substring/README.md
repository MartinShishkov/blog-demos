https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

Difficulty: HARD

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:

Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

**This problem was given to me in an interview with SBTech
It was the 1 of 3 problems at HackerRank, but I couldn't find it there
so I managed to get it in LeetCode
