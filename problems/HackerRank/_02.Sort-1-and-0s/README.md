# Sort 1s and 0s

This problem was given to me in an interview with SBTech in HackerRank,
alongside with 79.Minimum-Window and MinimumSum

I don't have the exact problem description but it goes something like this:
Given an array of 1s and 0s, find the least number of swaps of adjacent elements required to
sort the array. The direction of sorting does not matter.

Example:

[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] => 0

[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] => 0

[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0] => 1

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1] => 12
